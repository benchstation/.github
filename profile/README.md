# Welcome!

**Benchstation** is a personal organization repository I've created to keep track of my programming journey, configurations, and other personal resources. It serves as my own little digital nook where I store everything that helps me stay organized and learn more efficiently.

Currently, I'm in the process of transitioning my data to the cloud to safeguard against potential data loss, whether from hardware failure or other unforeseen events. With so much accumulated over the years, losing access to it would be a major setback.

Previously, much of this information was scattered in plain text files, but after discovering the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), I've decided to standardize my documentation. 

I'm a sucker for Markdown. It allows me to organize my thoughts more clearly :)

### Organization
To make my repository more efficient and easier to navigate, I've divided the content into the following sections:
- **Coding Journeys** – A collection of notes, tutorials, and examples on different programming languages I've been exploring.
- **Resources** – Links to configuration files, setup scripts, environment variables, libraries, or any external resources I find helpful.
- **Project Notes** – A place for project-related documentation, design ideas, and development progress for any ongoing or past projects.

## Table of Contents
To make it easier to find specific content, I've created this **Table of Contents** that lists all the key sections and pages in the repository.

### Coding Journeys
I also link relevant content within the repository, making it easy to reference other pages or external resources that might help me revisit or expand on certain topics. For instance:
- [C](https://github.com/benchstation/cLang)
- [Python](https://github.com/benchstation/Python)

### Resources
- [Configurations](https://github.com/benchstation/MyConfigs)
